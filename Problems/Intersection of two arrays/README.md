## c++ classes

In C++, a class is a fundamental building block that allows you to encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit. It serves as a **blueprint** for creating objects, which are **instances** of the class. Here's a breakdown of key concepts related to C++ classes.


### Declaration

To declare a class, use the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a set of curly braces containing member variables and member functions.

```cpp

class MyClass {
public:
    // Member variables
    int myInteger;
    double myDouble;

    // Member functions
    void printValues();
};
```

### Access Specifiers
C++ provides three access specifiers: public, private, and protected. These determine the visibility of class members.

public: Members are accessible from outside the class.
private: Members are only accessible within the class.
protected: Similar to private, but accessible in derived classes.

```cpp

class Example {
public:
    // Public members
    int publicVar;

private:
    // Private members
    double privateVar;

protected:
    // Protected members
    char protectedVar;
};
```

### Member Functions

Member functions define the behavior of a class. They are declared within the class and defined outside it using the scope resolution operator ::.

```cpp

void MyClass::printValues() {
    cout << "Integer: " << myInteger << ", Double: " << myDouble << endl;
}
```

### Constructors and Destructors

Constructors initialize object properties when an object is created. Destructors clean up resources when an object goes out of scope.

```cpp

class Person {
public:
    // Constructor
    Person(string name, int age);

    // Destructor
    ~Person();

private:
    string name;
    int age;
};

// Constructor definition
Person::Person(string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {
    // Initialization code
}

// Destructor definition
Person::~Person() {
    // Cleanup code
}
```

### Object Creation and Usage

Objects are instances of classes. They are created using the new keyword, and their members are accessed using the dot (.) operator.

```cpp

int main() {
    // Creating an object
    MyClass myObject;

    // Accessing members
    myObject.myInteger = 42;
    myObject.myDouble = 3.14;
    myObject.printValues();

    return 0;
}
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The derived class (subclass) can access public and protected members of the base class (superclass).

```cpp

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Animal is eating" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Dog is barking" << endl;
    }
};
```

### c++ data structures

**const**

**auto**

### c++ references

**&**

### vectors vs arrays

### c++ sets
